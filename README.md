## Project Description
This repository contains the code and data for my master thesis:

**"Escalation of Commitment and Behavioral Biases in Transfermarkt's Player Valuations in Professional Football"**

The project investigates potential biases in Transfermarkt's player valuations, focusing on escalation of commitment, anchoring, and overconfidence. The analysis covers over 1,000 players from Europe's top five leagues over four seasons (2017/2018 to 2020/2021).

**Methods**: Fixed effects panel regression models, empirical Bayes adjustment, and construction of an Overall Performance Index (OPI).

FBref for player performance metrics.\
Penaltyblog for team ratings.
